# Simple React User List Table App
by Tornike Rogava

This application is built on a fake API and simulates working with a database of users. \
Data is fetched from the "API" stored in state and displayed in a table.\
Users can edit and delete users from the list. \
Users can also probably tell that I do not have a degree in design.



##Technologies Used:
React, Redux (Thunk), Scss, Typescript

###
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
